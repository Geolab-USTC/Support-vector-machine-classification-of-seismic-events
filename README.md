# Support-vector-machine-classification-of-seismic-events
This package is the source code for support vector machine classification of seismic events (named SvmCoSE). SvmCoSE seek to classify seismic events based on the spectral characteristics of the sources, P/S ratios of the seismic observations and the percentage of event daytime occurrence.
